    'With the intention of having a more modern look I built this first personal portfolio to show my works to the world.\nThis project was created with Angular as front-end framework alongside of Firebase to handle the back-end structure in the most basic way. Using good practices I was able to take a deeper look at Angular animation and state management in the most efficient way for it.\nDesign with a very minimalist look in mind, it was the feel needed for a professional and modern portfolio.',
